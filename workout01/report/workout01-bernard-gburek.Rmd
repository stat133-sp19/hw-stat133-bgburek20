With three championships in the past four years, and a potential 4th championship on the way this year, the Golden State Warriors have been consistently the best NBA team of recent years and perhaps the greatest dynasty in NBA history. What has been responsible for their remarkable success these last couple of years? To answer this question, let's take a closer dive into the statistics of the 2016 season, in which the Warriors first acquired star small forward Kevin Durant.

  This project obtained data from .csv files from Basketball Reference on the shooting of the five Warriors in the "Death Ball lineup" in the 2015-2016 season: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, and Draymond Green. This data was used to create shot charts, summary statistics, and tables of shooting percentage and shot types for the purpose of better understanding the team's performance this season.

Perhaps it is best to begin by examining the performance of star point guard and two time MVP winner Stephen Curry. A quick look at Curry's shot chart gives some indication of what makes him one of the best players in the NBA. Curry takes very few midrange jumpers, generally regarded in the modern NBA as an inefficient shot. Instead, most of Curry's shots are behind the three-point line or are close to the basket indicating high efficiency in his shot selection. In fact, in the 2016-2017 season, Curry took even more 3 point shots than 2 point shots with 687 3 pointers compared to just 563 two-point shots. Much of Curry's famous shooting range is also on display in his shot chart, as many made 3 point shots are not only right on the line but are well behind the 3 point line. Despite taking higher difficulty shots from further distance and off the dribble instead of catch and shoots 3 pointers which are the specialty of fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson, Curry still shoots at an astonishing 40.8 percent from 3, which is 2nd on the team behind only Klay. Curry led the team in high difficulty step back jump shots with 75 on the year. Thus, even though Curry is only 4th in field goal percentage among the team’s big 5, his shot chart and 3 point percentage despite so many difficult attempts indicate his superstar value.

```


Next up, we’ll take a look at another MVP in Kevin Durant. Compared with Curry and Thompson, Durant takes much less 3 pointers which makes sense given that he shoots about 2 percent lower than Curry’s high difficulty 40% and Thompson’s 42% at 38%. Still, Durant’s 38% 3 point shooting is nothing to scoff at. Durant is an incredible all-around scorer, as his shot chart is littered with made shots from pretty much any spot on the court. It is unsurprising that Durant has the highest overall shooting percentage on the team at 54.1%. There is pretty much no weakness to the 6’9 SF’s scoring game.  However, Durant’s shot charts and 2 point percentage reveal his specialty, as one of the greatest midrange scorers in history. Although midrange scoring has declined in recent years, Kevin Durant has been an exception to this trend due to his excellent midrange jumper and isolation game. Durant takes more 2 point shots than anyone on the team, yet still shoots at the second highest percentage on these shots with 60.7%. Durant only played 62 out of 82 regular season games due to injury, but if he managed to play more games, it is likely that he would have had shot totals closer to that of Curry and Thompson with the same efficiency.

```

Now we’ll look at long-time Splash Brother Klay Thompson. For a long time, Thompson has been well-known as one of the best two-way guards in the league, as Klay almost always draws the task of guarding the opposing team’s best guard while also still contributing heavily on the offense end. Even with the addition of Kevin Durant in this season, Klay still added heavily to the offense with 1220 shots, narrowly behind Curry’s 1250. Although Klay isn’t always as talented of a shot creator as Durant or Curry and doesn’t take as many difficult shots, Klay is consistently one of the most efficient players on the team. Despite taking a similar number of total shots as Curry, Thompson shot a bit higher than Curry overall at 47.1% compared to Curry’s 46.7%. In 3 point percentage, Thompson easily shot the highest rate on the team at 42.4% despite shooting over 400 more 3s than Durant and the other players that season. Like Durant, Thompson’s shot chart is filled with blue dots from all over the court, indicating that there are many ways he can score on you. Thompson also shows some incredible 3 point range similar to that of Curry with several shots well beyond the 3 point line. Thus, while Thompson is often considered a bit inferior to Durant and Curry his performance still should not be discounted.

```


Finally, let’s take a look at two less prolific offensive players, but still important Warriors in Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala. Both players are consistently known for being some of the best defensive players in the league.  In the 2015 NBA Finals, Andre Iguodala earned the NBA Finals MVP award for his performance guarding LeBron James. In 2016, Draymond Green won the defensive player of the year award and is described as one of the most crucial components of the Warriors “death lineup,” where Green moves from Power Forward to Center. With three terrific scorers, Iguodala and Green have to take on a much smaller offensive burden. Throughout the season, Green and Iguodala took just 578 and 371 shots respectively, which barely surpasses 3rd place Kevin Durant’s 915 shots. Still, the two are not inefficient scorers. Iguodala has the 2nd highest shooting percentage on the team at 51.8% and the highest shooting percentage on two pointers of the five at 63.8%. Although last on the side in overall, 2 point, and 3 point percentage Green still shoots a respectable 42.4% overall and 49.4% on 2 point shots. Part of the reason for Green and Iguodala’s lack of attempts is due to their lack of 3 point shooting, as the two shoot just 36% and 31.9% respectively, despite frequently taking shots well below the difficulty of the other 3. This low three point shooting is reflected in the two’s shot charts. Although Green takes efficient shots, refraining from shooting midrange jumpers and focusing mostly on layups and 3 point shots, it seems that he is unable mainly to hit threes between the wing and the corner of the 3 point line.
Similarly, Iguodala has not shot many 3s from the top of the key and frequently misses on the wings and in the corners, suggesting that 3 point shots are not his strong shoot. Most notably in the 2015 series with the Cavaliers, the Cavaliers would intentionally leave Iguodala open on the 3 point line hoping that they would be able to contain the other Warriors scorers. However, Iguodala is still a good midrange scorer hitting most of his shots while going to his left hand and shoots a high percentage on layups as indicated by the high number of blue dots near the basket. 

```{r out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}

```

In conclusion, the Warriors have received much of their success as a result of a diverse bunch of scorers. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant can all score from pretty much any spot on the court, but each has their specialties. As point guard, Curry leads the offense and takes a high number of difficult three-point shots and layups while still maintaining efficiency. By playing with two excellent three-point shooters in Curry and Thompson, Durant is still able to dominate all over the court, but tends to take less 3 pointers and focus on his specialty in midrange jumpers. By feeding off the other two scorers, Thompson is able to shoot less difficult shots and maintain remarkable efficiency shooting at some of the highest percentages on the team. These three excellent scorers allow Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala to take less of an offensive burden and to avoid their lower percentage shooting on offense, so they can spend their energy on their excellent defensive games. Overall, this combined play has made the Warriors truly one of the best NBA teams to ever grace the court.
